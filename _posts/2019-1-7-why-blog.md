title: Why I'm starting a blog
---

I'm writing this first blog post in a single go, so I expect this will be a mess, but it'll help remind me why I decided to create this blog.  

In short, I'll be treating this blog as a sort of journal, not so much a journal where I describe my day to day life, but a journal in which I explore topics which interest me at the time of the blog post. As with most people, I change focus regularly, which means I think about all sorts of interesting things but never really explore them in depth. Writing blog posts will help me focus on a topic which I find interesting, which really ends up being a way to make myself learn things I really want to learn, but come up with reasons not to. In addition, it will help me improve as a writer, which I'm sure anybody reading this can appreciate, including future me.  

The idea behind this blog seems relatively personal, and part of me hopes nobody ever reads this, but having it available for anybody to read incentivizes me to keep posting.
